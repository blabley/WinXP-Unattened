       Processinganimation

----------------------------------------------------------

Preview:

 The Preview is currently only available for small
 resolution setups. Only changes made to the appropiate
 Resources will take visual effect. Of Cource all made
 changes get written to the dll.

SysSetup:

 Though for visual completeness Texts from syssetup.dll,
 if present in the same directory as the selected
 winntbbu.dll, are displayed, they are, at least at the
 moment, not editable.

Pictures:

 There are no validation Checks on the Bitmaps
 that you might use, so have to take care yourself.

 All Pictures are limited to the use of Bitmap Images.

 Every Bitmap has a display in the pictures editor
 with its current size, hold the mouse over that,
 and you will get a tip with the size microsoft has
 intended.

Fonts:

 The font that you use MUST be present and registered
 at the time of setup.

 Since only Fontname and Fontsize are stored in the .dll
 even though the dialog for fonts allows it, you cant use
 styles like bold etc.

Dont Knows:

 There are still some aspects in the resources
 i dont know what they are good for, any additional
 information is welcome.
